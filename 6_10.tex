10. An anonymous network is one in which processes do not have identifiers. Can you define a total order among events in an anonymous network of processes?

\blank[2*big]

Looking at the defintion of total ordering.
\blank
{\bf \em a \ll b iff either LC(a) < LC(b)\\
 or LC(a) = LC(b) and i < j}
\blank
where i < j is determined either by the relative values of the numeric process identifiers, or by the lexicographic ordering of their names.
\blank
when we have this situation:
\blank[15*big]

At this time,\\
LC(a) = LC(b).\\
In order to define the total ordering of the system.
The process numbers or names will be used to break the tie.\\
So, I can not define a total ordering among events in an anonymous network of processes.
