\subsection{Consider two Decision problems $\Pi$ and $\Pi^{'}$ both been NP-Complete problems. Prove that $\Pi$ polynomially transforms to $\Pi^{'}$ and vise versa. }

Prove: \\[0.4cm]
Since problem $\Pi \in$ NP-Complete, it is clearly that problem $\Pi \in$ NP. According to the definition of NP-Complete problem. \\[0.3cm]
1. It belongs to class NP. \\[0.3cm]
2. All the other problems in NP polynomially transform to it. \\[0.3cm]
Here we have $\Pi^{'} \in$ NP-Complete, obviously we can get $\Pi \propto \Pi^{'}$. \\[0.3cm]
And vise versa.
Problem $\Pi^{'} \in$ NP-Complete, so $\Pi^{'} \in$ NP; and $\Pi \in$ NP-Complete, we get $\Pi^{'} \propto \Pi$.
