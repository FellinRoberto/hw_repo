3. Calculate the vector clock values of the ten events {\bf \em a-j} in the diagram of Exercise 2. Use the vector clock values to prove that {\bf \em (d,h)} are concurrent events, but {\bf \em f} is causally ordered before {\bf \em e}.
\blank[20*big]
VC(d)=(4, 2)\\
VC(h)=(2, 3)\\
Due to 4 > 2 and 2 < 3,
VC(d) and VC(h) are incomparable, so we say that {\bf \em (d,h)} are concurrent events.

\blank[big]

VC(f)=(1, 1)\\
VC(e)=(5, 4)\\
Due to 1 < 5 and 1 < 4,
so we say that ${\bf \em f \prec e}$.
